        <p>In 1961 John F. Kennedy was president 
           of the United states of America. He 
           wanted to land humans on the moon. 
           At this time, the USA had just started attempting to land humans on the 
           moon. Both the president and NASA were confident in their abilities to make this happen.
           On the day of July 16th, 1969, Three astronauts named Neil Armstrong, Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin and Michael Collins were blasted off in the Apollo 11 space craft. A total of four days later, two of the astronauts, Neil and Edwin, set foot on the moon while Michael Collins orbited and took photos of the event.
           The event lasted for three hours, rocks were collected and experiments were done. Before leaving, a U.S flag was left on the moon.
